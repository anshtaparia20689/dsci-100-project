# Data Science Project: Planning Stage (Individual)

## Project Overview
This project is part of the UBC Data Science course.  
The goal is to explore and analyze data from a research video game server to answer the question:

**“What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter?”**

## Contents

- **players.csv** – Dataset containing player characteristics.  
- **sessions.csv** – Dataset listing session-level data (not directly used in this analysis).

## How to Run

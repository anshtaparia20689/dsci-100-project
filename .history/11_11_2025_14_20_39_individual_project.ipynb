    "   This checks if players who spend more time in the game are more likely to subscribe.  \n",
    "   It compares game engagement between subscribers and non-subscribers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Age vs. Played Hours, Coloured by Subscription:**  \n",

    "From these plots, several trends appear:\n",
    "- **Experienced players** (Veterans and Pros) have noticeably higher subscription rates than Amateurs.  \n",
    "- **Subscribers** generally spend more hours playing than non-subscribers, suggesting engagement predicts interest in the newsletter.  \n",

    "## Methods and Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal.** Predict whether a player subscribes to the newsletter (TRUE/FALSE) using traits in `players.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method.** Logistic regression (classification).  \n",
    "**Response:** `subscribe`  \n",
    "**Predictors:** `experience`, `gender`, `Age`, `played_hours`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this method?**  \n",
    "Logistic regression is chosen because it models a binary outcome and is easy to interpret. It estimates the probability that a player subscribes based on their characteristics, while keeping the model simple. Each coefficient describes how a one-unit change in a variable influences the odds of subscribing, allowing me to identify which player characteristics have the greatest effect. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Key assumptions.**  \n",
    "This method assumes that each observation (player) is independent, that the predictors are correctly coded, and that the relationship between the numeric variables and the log-odds of subscribing is approximately linear. It also assumes there is no extreme correlation among the predictors that could distort the coefficient estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations.**  \n",
    "A few challenges may affect the results. Missing values in the Age column could reduce the amount of usable data, and differences in how players report their information might add inaccuracy. The variable `played_hours` is likely right-skewed, meaning a few players have much higher values than most others, which may impact the model fit. There may also be a class imbalance if most players did not subscribe, making it harder for the model to correctly predict the smaller “subscribe” class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How the model will be compared and selected.**  \n",
    "To evaluate model performance, I will focus on how well it distinguishes between subscribers and non-subscribers. The  measures the model’s ability to rank players correctly by their likelihood of subscribing. I will also record accuracy and F1-score as supporting metrics to capture both overall performance and balance between precision and recall. Two versions of the logistic regression will be compared: one using raw played hours and another using a log transformation of played hours to address skewness. The version with the higher cross-validation AUC will be selected as the final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How the data will be processed to apply the model.**  \n",
    "Before fitting the model, I will prepare the data by converting categorical variables such as experience and gender into factor types and by imputing missing age values with the median. To prevent data\n"

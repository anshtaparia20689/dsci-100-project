    "## Methods and Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Use features in `players.csv` to predict whether a player subscribes to the newsletter (TRUE/FALSE).`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method:** Logistic Regression (classification).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Response:** `subscribe`  \n",
    "**Predictors:** `experience`, `gender`, `Age`, `played_hours`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this method?**  \n",
    "Logistic regression is chosen because it models a binary outcome and is easy to interpret. It estimates the probability that a player subscribes based on their characteristics, while keeping the model simple. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Key assumptions.**  \n",
    "This technique essentially assumes independence of each observation-that there is a linear relationship between the independent variables and the log-odds of the outcome. It assumes independence among the independent variables themselves, that is, not too highly correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations.**  \n",
    "A couple of limitations - like gaps in the Age field - will affect the model by shrinking usable data. On top of that, the `played_hours` feature is right-skewed; certain users clock way more hours than most, potentially throwing off predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How the model will be compared and selected.**  \n",
    "Before fitting the model, numeric predictors like `age` and `played hours` will first be standardized to put them on similar scales. This standardizes the data so that no one variable will have more impact on a model simply by virtue of having larger numeric values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How the data will be processed to apply the model.**  \n",
    "I'll prepare the data before fitting the model by converting categorical variables into factor types and imputing missing age values with the median. To avoid data leakage, imputation will be done inside the training set in the course of cross-validation. The dataset will then be split into a training and a testing set. In case the subscription variable is unbalanced, use a stratified split to make sure both classes are fairly represented in both subsets."
